# sketch-to-shoe
Project sketch-to-shoe is a thorough yet comprehensible reimplementation of the pix2pix GAN paper. It adheres to the PyTorch framework and is trained on various sketches/images of shoes. To sum it up, sketch-to-shoe transforms your outline/sketch of any footwear design to a realistic copy of the same.
